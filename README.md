An app which uses automated SMS messages to organize events with your contacts. We're currently in the process of building the app.


## Testing

### Unit Tests

From the root simply run `flutter test`. If everything is installed correctly all tests WILL pass. Please do this before you begin developing.

### Functional Tests

go to `lib/main.dart` and "start debugging" if in vscode. This will install the app on your current emulator. You may need to uninstall the app from your emulator if you get errors.

## Debugging

If you encounter any errors while developing which you think might effect other developers, please open up an issue describing the error. It's awesome when you hit an error and someone else has already solved it.
